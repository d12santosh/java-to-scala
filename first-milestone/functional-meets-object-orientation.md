##  Functional Programming meets Object Orientation

* Functional programming and object-oriented programming are two different ways of looking at a problem. 

* Functional programming puts special emphasis on the **Verbs** (Action/State/Occurence) of a program and ways to combine and manipulate them

* Object-oriented programming puts special emphasis on **Nouns** (Class of things) and attaches verbs to them 

* **Funcional Works on Verbs and Objected Oriented Works on Nouns : [FVON]**

* The two pproaches are almost inverses of each other, with one being **Top Down** and the other **Bottom Up**

* Object-oriented programming approaches software by dividing code into nouns or objects. Each object has some form of identity (self/this), behavior (methods), and state (members). After identifying nouns and defining their behaviors, interactions between nouns are defined

* Functional programming approaches software as the combination of functions. It tends to decompose software into behaviors, usually in a bottom-up fashion. Functions are viewed in a mathematical sense, purely operations on their input. All variables are considered immutable

* Attributes commonly ascribed to object-oriented and functional programming
